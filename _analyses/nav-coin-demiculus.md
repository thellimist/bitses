- Came out in 2014
- They built a blockchain company in 2015 which builds tools, gives seminars etc to their clients: https://encrypt-s.com/company/
- They work on Nav-coin but also other stuff as well. So their coin doesn't seem to support their funding. 
- Navcoin is just incrementally better than bitcoin but doesn't look like it is better than ethereum
- They have a really active github, reddit, telegram, twitter etc.
