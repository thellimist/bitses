- TrustToken allows users to tokenize any asset. A user must use an escrow to
  tokenise their assets. The escrow then mints new coins in a smartcontract
  representing the asset.
- A tokenized asset must have a way to give dividends.
- A user who owns TrustToken can stake their tokens to an asset to gain % of the
  dividend generated.
- TrustToken is ERC20 and the tokenized assets in TrustPlatform will be on
  Ethereum.
- First asset to be backed by TrustToken is TrueUSD.
- TrueUSD is a competitor of Tether. Tether is somewhat shady and notorious.
  Whenever someones stakes their TrustToken to TrueUSD, the token owner will
  earn dividend based on the trading fees of TrueUSD.
- Stable coins are one of the biggest markets of the future. Tokenized assets
  can represent $256 Trillion.
- The team hasn't done anything spectacular in the past, however, they have
  executed really well working on TrueUSD. They seem to be capable of executing a
  project this big.
- Once TrustToken is owned, it's best to research to projects where TrustTokens
  can be staked. Otherwise, the benefit of the coin will be decreased
  significantly.
- TrustToken value will increase based on the dividend the token can provide.
  More tokenized assets means more probability of an asset with higher dividends.
