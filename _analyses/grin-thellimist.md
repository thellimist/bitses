conclusion: "Nice tech but won’t have really world use cases. Is not better than Monero thus can’t win private transactions market."

- Implements MimbleWimble and Cuckoo Cycle PoW.
- First implementation of MimbleWimble. 
- Same degree of privacy compared to Monero but consumes less resources. Not order of magnitude less though
- The team looks capable. Rust is good design choice for a system like Grin. 
- Core dev ignopeverell or Ignotus Peverell is anonymous
- MimbleWimble is interactive meaning both parties need to send each other information. This doesn’t mean they both have to be online. The protocol can work async. In banking industry or bitcoin only the sender needs to send information meaning it's non-interactive. In my opinion interactive transactions are a single order of magnitude worse than non-interactive transactions.
