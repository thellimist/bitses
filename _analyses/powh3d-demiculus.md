General

- POWH3D is a unique cryptocurrency exchange which allows you to trade Ethereum for P3D tokens.
- Looks like a ponzi scam at first and it is partially. But it looks like it has evolved in to something else. 
- Most poular dapp right now.(25 Jul '18)
- Has been submitted on 4th of April and has [9k MAU](https://www.stateofthedapps.com/dapps/powh-3d) (monthly active users). The most active is idex with 35k MAU.
- There are [15k token holders](https://etherscan.io/token/tokenholderchart/0xb3775fb83f7d12a36e0475abdd1fca35c091efbe)
- Their marketing with 'Just Token' is brilliant, it is an advertising token which is owned by more than 1.6 million ETH addresses. It is worthless, you can't trade it, sell it or redeem for value. Any attempts to remove it from your wallet simply result in you getting more of them.
- From the content I've seen, I can easily say that the team is one of the smartest & most knowledgable people in the industry. 

How it works: 

- When you buy or sell a token 10% of it goes as a fee to all other p3d token holders as Ethereum. 
- When you buy tokens you first get the tokens, then the token holders get dividends which includes you. 
- When you sell the tokens you first lose the tokens, then the remaining token holders get dividends.
- Each buy increases the price by 10gwei, each sell decreases it by same amount. 
- The token/exchange has no developer fee. The developers also purchased themselves. Though they purchased early on so it makes sense.
- Masternodes can be built and they can share their link to get extra earnings.
- If a friend buys 10ETH from your masternode, you make 0.3ETH. (3%)
- There are also games being developed on top of this coin which also reward the token holders. Most notable example is [Fomo3d](http://exitscam.me/shakedown).

Cases: 

In the case of you investing 10ETH things that could happen are below;

1. Everyone buys/sells and you just hold; you will get many dividends.
2. Noone buys sells and you just hold; you'll have lost 2 ETH (20%) after you sell.
3. Everyone sells; You'll be the last person in the system where you earn enormous amount of ETH dividends while everyone is selling.
4. Everyone buys; The dividends you earn will go down slowly as the token amount increases but your tokens will be worth a lot more. 

Questions:

1. If we bought p3d token on average how many new ether would need to enter the market for us to breakeven (get back the 20% loss)?
2. What is the expected time that this new ether will enter the p3d ecosystem?
3. We can buy p3d token when it goes down in price vs now, if we bought the p3d token right now and its price continued to fall at what point do we become break-even? (since the token will also give dividend while people are selling thus it might be reasonable to buy now rather than later)?

Answers:

1. To be calculated
2. To be calculated
3. To be calculated

I haven't finished calculating because I've realized that secondary markets can be built on top of it thus automatically making the system partially obsolete.

Conclusion

- This is an interesting project. The first I've seen using the token bonding technology.
- With a centralized token exchange or a secondary token contract half of the value can be ripped from the system thus decreasing its effectiveness.
- Proof of weak hand actually works because if you sell early you lose. The longer you hold the better until the secondary systems become live.
- If a lot of casino games are built on this token and it becomes the norm for such applications the value will skyrocket regardless of its own mechanics. Thus we should wait and see if other developers will create games on top of this token.
