conclusion: "Using centralized influencer marketing tools is better than using Sether."
---

- ICO price was $3.6, current trading price is $0.19
- They market the coin like Sether is solving Facebook & Google being marketing
monopolies but in reality they are doing influencer marketing which is a totally
different field.
- They don't have any useful code open-source:
  https://github.com/mware-solutions
- ""Sether is an oracle service"" is written on their white paper. They've also
  written that there needs to be a trusted oracle service in a few places on
  their white paper. This means that when people use their smart contracts they
  will need to trust the Sether team. There are many centralized tools that
  solve the same problem.
- They have just put an extra layer with smart contracts. This is done better as
  a centralized system.
