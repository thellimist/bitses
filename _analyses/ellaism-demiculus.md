conclusion: "- Fork of ETH, has no unique value, shit coin"

- Their tagline is a fair ethereum, which means they copied eth, but they haven't premined or have dev fees.
- Having no dev fees makes the coin worse not better.
- Having no premine is not exactly a plus. The creators & investors need incentive to create & invest.
