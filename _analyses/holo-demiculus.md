conclusion: "Questions:\n1. How does the distributed validation work? https://youtu.be/hyCtYrHJebs?t=4m30s\n2. There are more misc people on the team than developers, is this good?\n3. They say holo is not a token, not a coin but a mutual credit. I didn\'t understand the difference. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn7aWuerBB8\n4. - \"App Providers go through real world identity verification when they sign their agreements for hosting apps on Holo.\" how is it decentralized? (they also mention that it will start semi-centralized and gradually holo will stop existing and holochain will become completely decentralized."

- Not a blockchain but a DHT like bittorent
- They have strong connections (CFO of Mozilla & Co-founder of Netflix)
- Project is in alpha but can still be built on using JS & Lisp
- Holo fuel will be live in Q3 2018
- It looks awesome on paper, anyone who looks at it for an hour will not see that token won't work. (we should invest at least 10%)
- We can hodl until holo fuel becomes live
- Founder(Arthur Brock) has been a CTO since 1996 and has been working on currencies since 2004
- They are hiring devs
- They've written protocol with Go
- They are agent centric(like git) rather than data centric(like bitcoin). So when an agent create a git repo only he has the power to change it. But doesn't prevent anyone from forking it.
- I didn't understand the technical part of the white paper, it may take me 5-10hours to think and understand it.
- They have TODOs in their whitepaper
- They have green paper & currency paper
- They use mutual credit, which means the token supply is always zero. When someone creates tokesn someone else goes to negatives.
- They use double entry ledger system, I'm not sure if it'll work.
- They have put some normal weaknesses in their Currency paper saying that they don't have good solutions for some attack types.
- Coins which have this much depth & tech with good marketing has a 99% chance of entering top 30 (which means increasing 4x from where it is right now)
