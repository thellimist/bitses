- Founder is one of the exfounders of Antshares(NEO) and former director of Ant Financial’s Blockchain operation.
- Their github is one of the most active githubs in crypto space.
- They started a incentive program with 5M$ price pool. They are aiming to get developers’ attention.
- They do not focus on marketing right now, it seems development is their priority.
- Whitepaper is very comprehensive.
- Partnerships with GIFTO and Dolphin Browser.
- Three core elements of Nebulas, Nebulas Force(NF), Nebulas Rank(NR) and Nebulas Incentive(NI) will be online in 2018.
- In terms of exchange listing, their CEO said they will end up in binance and bithumb sooner or later. ( https://twitter.com/HittersXu/status/990256163320094720 )

My thoughts and concerns:
- They are aiming to be a 3rd generation blockchain but most people know them as just a search engine. This should change.
- 3rd generation blockchain market is very competitive, they are relatively unknown compared to their competitors.
- PoD algorithm should be investigated, how they are going to determine “influential” users and will it be really different from PoS’s “rich gets richer” phenomena.
- They are trying to get developer’s attention by incentive program, I think this is a very good strategy.
- Their marketing has been terrible so far. The reason might be they heavily focused on product development and mainnet release.
- I think project can climb up to top 20 or even top 10 if they keep delivering and start proper marketing.
