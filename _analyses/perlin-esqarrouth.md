PERLs acquired during this Private Sale process will be subject to a 2-month lock-up from the date of listing on a cryptocurrency exchange which is within the top ten globally in terms of daily trade volume. So we won't be able to sell it unless its on a global popular exchange? Maybe it won't ever get to that point? Or maybe it will be dumped until then?
We are pleased to open up the Private Sale for 10 days until 30 June. During this time the Perlin Token (PERL) will have a 20% discount and will be US 20c per PERL (reduced from 25c). This Private Sale will have a 30K ETH hardcap so if you are interested to purchase PERLs, please respond to this email with an indication of how many PERLs you would like to buy.

Doesn't look like a obvious scam. Just looks like a stealth project. But it can be a scam and we can never be sure about it.
