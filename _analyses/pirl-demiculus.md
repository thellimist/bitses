- Their tagline is by people for people (but so is all the other open source projects)
- Their unique selling point is that they are creating a marketplace on the blockchain
- They never needed a new blockchain to create a marketplace, they can use btc or eth or any other blockchain.
- They've just forked ethereum code and haven't built much on top of it
- They haven't updated the core for more than a month
