- 18m coins premined and 2m coin left for mining
- Uses a bunch of technologies to be private. Itâ€™s not more private than Monero.
- They airdrop constantly
- They do good marketing 
- They are trying to get stores use deep onion which is their entry to market however privacy coin = banned coins for governments. Stores will probably not accept privacy coins. 
- Their marketcap seems low compared to other privacy coins in this level
- They seem to have a bigger community than expected
