conclusion: "I think the team is doing an okay job at marketing. They've pumped the coin to top 30 and have a unique selling point so the coin could go much higher before people realize its tech doesn't work (if tech doesn't work)\nOverall I don't want this blockchain/team to become succesful."

- Each account needs to be payed in order to keep open thus incentivices deleting accounts
- Their whitepaper is technical in depth
- They are using almost everything from already created techs.
- Plagirsm %7 with lightning network, %6 with solidity
- Their innovations are in 
1. oracles (binding real world data w blockchain data)
2. They say state channels is innovation but it seems like a copy of lightning network
3. Cuckoo Cycle Pow, John Tromp has created this and he is their advisor
- Oracle creator stakes a coin to provide a yes/no question answer to the chain. If another person also provides an answer and if they are not the same the blockchain consensus decides who's data is right or wrong. Which may have a lot of risks in real world trials.
- Really active github
- Naval & nick szabo follows their old CTO Zack Hess
- Their old CTO has left Aeternity to work on his new project where he tweeted this: which says his newer blockchain is better https://twitter.com/zack_bitcoin/status/990177154863378432
- Here is progress report on oracle tech by Ex-CTO: https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/amoveo/blob/master/docs/progress_reports/April_2018.md
- They have banned Zack from Aeternity: https://twitter.com/zack_bitcoin/status/904056622523138048
- The founder Yanis looks more like soft core developer(like me), he doesn't seem to understand the tech very well.
- Zack explains why he left, the team looks uncapable of holding good players: https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/amoveo/blob/master/docs/why_I_left.md

Questions:
1. What are the cases that could go wrong with the the oracles they have designed?
2. Do the remaining members of this team have enough skill to develop a useful coin or would it be a gimmick?
3. Can this team market the coin well so that it becomes the standard oracle blockchain?
4. I didn't quite understand the tech and such kan needs to look. (look at Cuckoo Cycle Pow)

If teamCanMarket() && techWork(): invest because they are early
else: dontInvest()

Doruk says they have changed another CTO after Zack. So their tech will probably never work.
