conclusion: "Whitepaper seemed promising, but lack of activity dissuaded me from further research. I would be surprised if they made it to top 200."

- From whitepaper: "In Karbo project we set a goal of creating such decentralised, community oriented medium of
exchange, a stable cryptocurrency with low price volatility by introducing new to crypto world
technics of regulating coin supply to stabilize its market price and exchange rate."
- Seeks to bring stability by implementing a variable supply mechanism as defined in Vitalik's stablecoin article: https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/11/search-stable-cryptocurrency/
See the section "Endogenous Solution"
- Team is Ukrainian, kind of like the e-akce project of Turkey
- Monero is also based on cryptonote. Since Monero's inception, a guy called Zawy came up with a better difficulty algorithm: https://github.com/zawy12/difficulty-algorithms/issues/3
There are a bunch of projects that just fork old ones and apply the new algorithm, and call themselves original projects. 
Karbo is not one of them since it is _also_ trying to implement a variable supply mechanism.
- Team members do not show themselves on the Karbo webpage. They don't seem very keen on marketing.
They say they won't do an ICO and there is no premine/instamine. Karbo development is supported by donations.
Talked with admins on telegram, they told me "there is no ICO, fuck off", when I tried to ask their background.
Code development seems slow. Devs don't seem very ambitious.
