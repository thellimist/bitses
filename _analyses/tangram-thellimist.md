- Nodes will be private
- I couldn't see if Tangram makes use of cryptoeconomics. It's similar to Stellar, but Stellar makes use of trust. Tangram doesn't. 
- No incentives for running a node.
- They are using something called SWIM (from Cornell University. Author named: asdas ðŸ˜‚). https://drive.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ddf0/9d46c0124f7d05aa1b065c594a2031e1c4ff.pdf 
- They are using Gitlab rather than Github. I'm not sure if this actually has significant business (contribution) value but I hate Gitlab as an opensource community platform.
- Tangram doesn't use Ring signatures to achieve privacy.
- Most unique part about Tangram is their faucet distribution model. Basically people solve puzzles and images. I think this a good way to distribute tokens. Stellar and other premined tokens could distribute in this way. They can solve a problem and distribute the tokens. More info here https://blog.goodaudience.com/tangram-faucet-distribution-economics-overview-72141e9562bf. 
- Faucets will be live for 3 month to 8 months. In my opinion the distribution length seems too short. If Tangram can't market enough the distribution might not be sufficient. Also, a person who learns about Tangram 3 years later will only be able to buy Tangram. 
- Testnet shows 2x speed compared to Monero. Since it's a DAG Main network speed can vary a lot. It's also not that correct to compared both. Monera has dynamic blocksize and hasn't hit tps limit yet. 
- Blockchain bloat is another problem with privacy coins. I'm still looking into it.
