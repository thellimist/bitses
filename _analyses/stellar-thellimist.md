Stellar focuses on transaction, however, it also has the potential to be the platform where real world assets will be tokenized. It is totally possible for a person to go to an Anchor (a bank), tokenize their house, sell it to the mass and give dividend to each token holder. They are currently not focusing on this which I think is a smart move. If they can win the transaction market, tokenization market will be a lot easier.
