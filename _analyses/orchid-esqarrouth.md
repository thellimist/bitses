conclusion: "They will probably raise $125M already and would possibly be too overvalued. But they might not reach the higher limit because no one is working on marketing this coin. This is an insta top 50 coin which can bring market cap to $350M. Easily 3x with high possibility of going top 10 ($4B), which means 25x realistic upside. Not the best investment but less risky. Any amount invested is locked up for at least 1 year. They have a lot of competition in this space."
