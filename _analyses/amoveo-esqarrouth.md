conclusion: "Risky revenge coin. High potential like 10-100x increase. But good chance to go to zero. Invest no more than 5%, but should easily gamble 0.5%. "

- Creator, Zack is followed by Nick Szabo, Naval, Richard Burton and some other legit crypto people.
- Zack is in hero mode and developing everything by himself. He's been developing for more than 1.5 years and did more work than most other blockchain projects. Lines of code written: 11K ERL. 8K JS.
- Project is very new, very unknown expect to hard core long term blockchain enthusiasts.
- Looks like the market cap was over $6 million. (Maybe?)
- VEO/BTC exchange is being built.
- Admirable style and work ethic, written by Zack: 

The 2 previous blockchain projects Zack founded:
* Raised tens of millions in ICO.
* Hired dozens of people.
* Have not launched main net yet.
* Mediocre growth.

Amoveo:
* Raised $0 in funding.
* Hired no one.
* Launched main net 2 months ago.
* Rapid growth.

Pros:

- Founder looks like one of the hardest working blockchain developers there is.
- A bigger community than a lot of $50M projects is out there trying to help Zack on this product. 
- No exchange yet, can only buy OTC from official Discord channel. An opportunity. 

Cons:

- Founder might possibily hinder the growth of the project because of idealism. 
- Code quality seems low.
