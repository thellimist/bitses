tldr: "Torrent for application hosting"
score: 3

conclusion: "Real work is being done. There seems to be a few concept problems which they may overcome later on. This coin definitely deserves top 50 and probably top 20"

General

- Not a blockchain but a DHT like bittorent
- Project is in alpha but can still be built on using JS & Lisp
- Holo fuel will be live in Q3 2018
- They are agent centric(like git) rather than data centric(like bitcoin). So when an agent create a git repo only he has the power to change it. But doesn't prevent anyone from forking it.
- I didn't fully understand the technical part of the white paper, it may take me 5-10hours to think and understand it.
- They have TODOs in their whitepaper.
- They have green paper & currency paper also legit.
- They use mutual credit, which means the token supply is always zero. When someone creates tokens someone else goes to negatives.
- They use double entry ledger system, I'm not sure if it'll work.

Pros

- They have strong connections (CFO of Mozilla & Co-founder of Netflix)
- It looks awesome on paper, anyone who looks at it for an hour will not see that token won't be valuable in the upcoming years. But it will still be valuable in the short term. 
- Founder(Arthur Brock) has been a CTO since 1996 and has been working on currencies since 2004
- They are hiring devs
- They've written protocol with Go
- They have put some normal weaknesses in their Currency paper saying that they don't have good solutions for some attack types. This shows they know their weaknesses and are working to overcome it. Thus increases their chance of surviving.
- Coins which have this much depth & tech with good marketing has a 99% chance of entering top 30 (which means increasing 4x from where it is right now)
- Other good & legit blockchain projects are stealing ideas from them. (ex: Skycoin)

Cons

- Their token economy looks flawed. But the team is smart & they have put real work into it and invented a few concepts thus they have the potential to overcome this.

Questions:

1. How does the distributed validation work?

2. There are more misc people on the team than developers, is this good?
3. They say holo is not a token, not a coin but a mutual credit. I didn't
understand the difference. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn7aWuerBB8
4. 'App Providers go through real world identity verification when they sign their agreements for hosting apps on Holo.' how is it decentralized? (they also mention that it will start semi-centralized and gradually holo will stop existing and holochain will become completely decentralized.
