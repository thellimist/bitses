conclusion: "They are basically giving ICO/investment advice & helping people do ICO's. Thus they are actually a consultancy firm which has created their own coin, where I didn't understand why they needed the coin in the first place. Since they are updating & publishing more stuff their price can increase in the short term, but I see no long term value for this coin."

- They are pretty active for a coin their size
- They have forked a coin and don't seem to have done any innovation
- They've been updating their github rigorously the past few days.
- They have published a new whitepaper (a few days ago) which looked really legit at the first glance but as I read more into it, it is a business paper not a technical paper which doesn't include game theories & other formulas solving problems.
- Sent them email, the email adress doesn't exists.
