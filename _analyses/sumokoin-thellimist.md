conclusion: "Probably just a scam fork monero"
---

- Fork of Monero changing some parameters they didn't like
- The devs actually implemented some features
- People on reddit say If BTC is Monero, Sumo is like LTC, the place where tech is tried. However their codebase hasn't been updated for some time..
