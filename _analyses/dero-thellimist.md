- Dero claims lots of stuff. The claims are really bold. Their source code is private so no one can reivew. 
- They are writing new cryptography without any proper peer reivew
- The lead developer Captain Dero pushed away his most important allies. (Check the link below)
- Captain Dero hid a huge information where the block times were 3 minitues whereas they are supposed to be a few seconds. He hid this information from miner for 200 days
- This medium post is the most important resource you can find about Dero. https://medium.com/@mojo_lb/to-whom-captain-deros-lead-developer-feels-it-does-not-concern-6df0a9ca692a
- Even if the technology works (I doubt it will), without a proper leader the project is doomed.
