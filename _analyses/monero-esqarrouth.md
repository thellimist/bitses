conclusion: "Most legit store of value coin after BTC. But it probably won't increase in rank and not a good investment."
---

-Secure, private untraceable cryptocurrency.
-No way to link transactions, trace history.
-Seems to be better store of value and transaction system than Bitcoin.        
-Bytecoin fork.        
-Totally legit distribution. 
-Development funded by opening requests and users funding them.
-Anon coin has mostly anonymous team.        
-No leader, no one is really taking charge in the project.
-No team is working fulltime on the project.
- Has inflation
-All blockchains being open and transparent might lead to countries spying and taxing users. This might lead everyone to adopt more anonymous coins and Monero might get into top 3 because of this.
