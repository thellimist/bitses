conclusion: "- This is probably a scam"

- The first video I watched on their website didn't have background sound, it was very low quality. A good team won't put such a video on their site. It is really shitty: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeVvUD5pCkw
- They've made a tool where people can create apps without coding. Their main goal should be attracting talented developers not the opposite.
- CEO literrally says he is a business guy who has hard time communicating with developers.. lol
- Big team 100% indian
- Team isn't S or A class. Team isn't awesome.
- According to their linkedin CTO started working on the centralized product in 2014 where the CEO seems to have taken over it in 2016
- The site is really ugly, one of the worst designs I've seen in the entire space
- Their whitepaper is shallow
- They have 0 open source code
- They are raising 40M which is too much. Are they just greedy?

Some comment I found (https://icodrops.com/sparkster/)
Some things Sparkster don't want you to know
1. This was already a failing web company just months ago. They changed the name, deleted all records of that company and pretended they were blockchain. They had 0 investors befor Baline came along
2. Their CEO claims to be from CISCO. He worked there on a call centre two decades ago. He has zero experience in blockchain and has had nothing but small failed businesses in those 20 years
3. They have a workforce in India that they pay peanuts to hang around their own telegram group telling people that this will 50x. Check their twitter and you will see about 100 fake comments under every tweet.
4. They do not have any partnerships, have zero proper VC companies backing them. Only Ian Balina who is a paid shill. Not one staff member is from a blockchain background. Their "development" team are an outsourced tech sweatshop in Mumbai where they are paying around $500 per month wages.

- I checked out the coin because it had 3 stars here: icoanalytics.net, their previous 3 stars had all performed well. 
- Also sparkster is IAN Balinas top pick. He is shilling it a lot. Thus IAN Balina should not be trusted with any review.

Edit: icoanalytics.net later on updated their stars and gave it a 1 star.
