Huobi token is in the same category as binance, kucoin, bibox thus it wouldn't be too far off to say that it easily has the potential to increase 2x+
Huobi token will also be used the same way as bnb token though since they aren't claiming they are making a dex it is normal for it not to be as valuable or as hyped as bnb.
