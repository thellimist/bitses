## The Team 

We're a team of developers, analysts, investors & fund managers. We've been in the cryptocurrency space since 2013. Our teams are based in Toronto, Istanbul & Ankara. 

## Why This Site Exists

We were already doing research for our investments. But the more we've seen our friends get scammed by icos the more we felt the need to share our knowledge hence we are here. We're open sourcing all of our data. We're hoping we can contribue to the field by being the most honest research group & exposing scams as much as possible.  

## What You Can Do

- Help out your friends by sharing Bitses.

## Other Projects

We're building an exchange for Amoveo, one of the most undervalued coins that we know which is currently being traded by OTC. You may register at https://amoveo.exchange/ to learn when it is launched.

We're also working on a wallet holder. You can get your username at http://mywallets.co/ before anyone else gets it.
