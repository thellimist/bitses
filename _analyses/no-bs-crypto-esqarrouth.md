- Utility token based on a community of 100k+ strong crypto enthusiasts and experts. 
- Crypto-related projects approach No BS Crypto to be rated and reviewed by a team of vetted and trusted, publicly anonymous reviewers.
- Part of the community bids on a certain ICO to be reviewed. A reviewer reviews the project and gets paid in ETH. About $100 per reviewer is expected to be earned from here.
- NOBS token are used to bid on projects. 
- Token purchase sources: Exchange, airdrop, community participation.
- There will be different reviewing categories. White paper analysis, Tokenomics analysis, Github analysis, Smart contract analysis, Founders and advisory team research, final report assembling.
- Once all reviewers have finished their respective assignments, their findings are sent to a reviewer in charge of data compilation and assembly into a clean and standardized report in PDF format, with a final numeral grade given to each project. 
- Reviewers are then paid based on their expected amount going into the project. Higher skillsets will be compensated more generously than low skillsets. Reviewers will collectively earn 80% of the fee charged by No BS Crypto to the crypto project. 20% will be retained by No BS Crypto for overhead.
- Each reviewer will be categorized internally and based on their skill set. Reviewers won't be publicly known so this reduces the risk of getting bribed for high ICO scores.
- This rating and report will be posted on noBScrypto.com, within its respective category for the world to see.
- System seems more complicated then it should be.
- Reviewers on projects won't know each other to prevent collusion.
- Extra revenue model: Projects that get favorable review can pay extra and be promoted on the website or social medias.
- The teams first product was 1-4 week algorithmic signals. Then ICO reviews, now this token. They're going after what the market is demanding.
- Planning to add to exchanges in summer 2018.
- Only listed on 1 exchange at the moment. The exchange they are listed: Bitforex seems to have issues.

- 70K members in Telegram, 2K members in Discord, 80K on Twitter.
- Ronnie Moas is following the founder Chris.

- Total Supply:        10,000,000,000 NOBS
- 10% for founders & advisors, 25% company operations, 65% for community. 
- 37431 addresses hold the token, pretty good decentralization of the tokens. All distributed via airdrops. (Via ethscan)
- Max valuation atm is $10M, seems in the appropriate range for this project. 

Positives:

- Strong and active community can get this coin listed in a lot of exchanges. 
- Team has the relevant experience in differentiating scam projects from nonscam ones.

Negatives:

- The company listed in their whitepaper: NO BS Crypto, LLC, couldn't be searched and found. 
- McAfee is an advisor. (Good influence for the initial stage of the project, bad influence now)
- Team doesn't have any idea about the big picture after the differentiating the scam stage. 

Team:

- Founder served as a fulltime missionary in Hungary church for 2 years.
- Studied weak business programs in from low tier universities. 
- Previously founded local phone repair and phone recycling company chains. Sold businesses and made $9M in sales.
- Founder seems to be good at operations. 
- Developer: Justin Waite, competent JS developer. Is working as CTO on another startup at the moment. Actively pushing code. Not working full time on NOBS. Also was a missionary. 
- Matthew Waite listed as software developer in the whitepaper. He is listed as a community manager in the website. But is only studying engineering at the moment.
- Kirk Salisbury their marketing guy seems like the reason they've gathered such a community. But is working as a webmaster in Utah.
- They claim to have an anonymous PhD guy.

Conclusion:

- Solving a real problem, but not a real decentralized project. Its crowdsourced information gathering with a centralized company calling the shots and making revenue. 
- No crypto-influencer recognizes the project as legit. So there are social and branding challenges after some scale. 
- High possibility for 2x-5x. Maybe 10x. Probably won't ever go 100x.
