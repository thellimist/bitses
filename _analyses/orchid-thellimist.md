conclusion: "This team is probably best suited to do something like this if it's possible on Ethereum blockchain. It is probably expensive to buy. The ROI won't be huge but there still good room here."

- Team is awesome
- Investors are awesome
- In their whitepaper they don't mention if the weak spot of privacy which is Ethereum can be solved in production manner. They mention every possible attack, every possible scenerio in the whitepaper. They definitely know what they are doing however I'm sceptical if the solutions of the privacy part will work cheap enough in Ethereum blockchain..
- Sharding on Ethereum is a must for Orchid.
- It has the potential to be the most used dApp on Ethereum. 

Questions:
- Will the gas cost be low enough for people to use?
- Even if the gas cost is high, will it be better and more attractive than Tor?
