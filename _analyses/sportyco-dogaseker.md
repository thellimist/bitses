conclusion: "Sounds interesting, but the game mechanics don't work."
---

- Platform released recently (april 2018).
- ERC20 token,
- hard-working team from sports industry.
- Well known names especially from ex- yugoslavian countries and celebrities
like Figo, roberto carlos etc.
- Trying to expand to asian market.
- Exchanges look promising (OKEX- Hitbtc- Kucoin and rumours about one more big one)
- Lack tecnical details & blockchain related documents- work etc.
- Project sounds good but a lot of things to do and a lot of work needed!!
- When teams raise money as sportycoin they need to dump it so that they can
  fund the project which in turn decreases the tokens value.
