- Javascript development, and the architecture if it works properly it might have a chance bring more developers thus have more dApps than Ethereum. However, there are lots of Blockchain projects allowing smartcontracts to be developed using Javascript. I think they are too late. Ethereum is already too far ahead. They need more than Javascript to distinct themselves. 
- CTO doesn't look bright (but acts smart) and has no trace of what he did for 15 years before Lisk
- People are excited about the idea javascript + blockchain. I don't think it is a good idea. Javascript is not the best tool for handling financial applications.
