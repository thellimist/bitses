https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chronobank,chronobank,2018-05-11,Demi,"- ERC20 token
- 90% of their code is javascript
- They haven't been doing a lot of coding in the past year but in the past month they have updated all of the repos.
- Finished their ICO in Feb'17(raised $5M) and in the market since Mar'18 (mcap = $10M)
- They have put the techs they have used for their dapps as partners in their site. (ex: waves, ethereum, 0x..)
- Founder have put himself as Advisor to SingularityNet, but on singularity net website he isn't listed, I emailed singularity team.
- Telegram has 55k members (skycoin 8k) has 1/100 of activity that skycoin has
- 2k subs on reddit, almost 0 activity
- Means they haven't been able to build a community for 1 year
- they say that they are building a stable token called Labor hour which is semi-centralized which will be used to pay the freelancers. ",-1,Less than 1 hour,Coin used to hire workers for freelance/labor jobs,"Shitcoin, but they've started marketing more agressively the past month thus there can be an increase in the price if they succeed. If they don't it'll be a waste. So it would only be a gamble according to their marketing skills. "
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mintcoin,mintcoin,2018-05-11,Demi,"- Fork of Novacoin which is fork of Bitcoin
- The developers have long abbandoned the coin
- Shane Kerr saw this coin and decided to take over in Feb: https://github.com/shane-kerr/MintCoin-Development-Updates/blob/master/2018-02-01.md
- He has been publishing weekly updates to the wallet ever since and is thinking about teaming up/merging/doing partnerships with other small timer coins.
- He has just been updating the desktop wallet by himself but nothing new has been added to the coin yet.
- Has market cap of $10M",-1,Less than 1 hour,One of the first POS projects in 2014,"If Shane gets more people working on this coin, they can get the coin up 5-10x from where it is in to the top 300, 200.
But since the tech is old and doesn't provide a good innovation they will not be able to penaterate the top coins ever. Thus shit coin."
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aigang,aigang,2018-05-15,Demi,"- Built on top of ethereum
- White paper looks ameteur, they didn't invent most concepts but no referrals are given
- Github sucks, no real development can be seen
- It has been more than 6 months and their docs still have todos everywhere: https://aigang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/platform/predictions.html
- They don't look like they have anyone in the team capable of building a protocol",-1,Less than 1 hour,Insurance Protocol,"They look like they have just did ICO, took money and did nothing else."
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/amoveo,amoveo,2018-05-15,Demi,"- is not on any exchange, did not do ico
- Governance model includes increasing block reward to not over-reward the earlier miners, which may kind of make it a stable coin
- Founder (zack) implemented Augur & Aeternity which stil have not launched. Amoveo has launched in Mar'18
- Zack is a solo founder, doesn't have a team, needs a business/marketing guy to make this project grow faster
- Has managed to attract good developers & built a strong early community
- Naval & Nick Szabo follows him on twitter
- They do everything from github, there is no website or anything like that.
- Mcap is at $6M but it has only been mined for 2 months. Thus a lot of the coins have not been created.
- This means that the market cap will increase dramatically but not the coin price. Also there is an in built governance system where people decide how many coins are going to be generated.
- Which means miners will capture most of the value not investors.
- They create a prediction market where people bet on predictions and the results are concluded with oracles.
- Uses pow (nakamoto consensus)
- In their mission statement they say Amoveo is for derivatives: https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/amoveo/blob/master/docs/mission_statement.md
- Derivative markets are highly developed in developed countries so their target market is southeast asia & africa
- They have 2 way channels & also lightning network for multi people trades
- Smart contracts are in channels
- Amoveo has derivatives not subcurrencies where you can exchance euro, lira, bitcoin, wheat, coffee, oil etc. which are the same price as real market
- Nash equilibrium makes sure people are hones in oracles, when people are dishonest forks people who think the right way will just move to the right fork, miners will defend the right fork for more capial gain
- Zack has lived with Jae Kwon creator of tendermint for a couple months.

Questions
1) does game theory work?
2) How many txps does prediction market needs? How many does Amoveo do?
3) Current inflation rate per year?
4) Why does Zack want to create ASIC?

Answers
1) In theory, game theory should work: https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/amoveo/blob/master/docs/design/oracle_motivations.md
2) Prediction market needs 1tx per person per month. With big blocks and sharding it can scale up to 10B Tx per month. It is not the best solution but a solution that would work: https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/amoveo/blob/master/docs/design/scalability.md
3) Inflation rate will be near optimal: https://www.reddit.com/r/Amoveo/comments/8kqhwn/what_is_the_estimated_inflation_rate_of_amoveo/
4) He wants miners to only be able to mine Amoveo.

I believe it will increase in price as people discover this gem."
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/atlant,atlant,2018-05-17,Demi,"- ERC20 token
- They plan on doing ICOs for shopping malls and other real estates. So people can buy & trade a fraction of the mall.
- Their white paper looks very legit (work has been put in to it)
- The coin price is 20% of the ico price where ICO happened in 1 Nov
- Up until the ICO they tweeted daily after the ICO they tweet once a month
- They push new code about once a week.
- They are far behind their road map but have not update their road map.
- They seem to be more focused on regulatory things than the actual tech.
- In telegram the admin said when they finalize the regulatory problems they will update the site and then do the product release which I think will probably increase the token price by a lot.
- They go to blockchain events take pics with famous people (like vinny)
- The method of tokenizing a proprety goes like this: They buy a property, put it in to a special purpose company, then tokenize that company. I'm not sure why ATL is needed here.
- It might be better if they just tokenize properties without having their own coin. Thus they become a service company.
- Emailed Maxim(https://github.com/xlab) who implemented their node: https://github.com/AtlantPlatform/atlant-go . He said that he is a freelancer who is working on atlant and another project at the time. And his hourly rate is $40.",0,Less than 5 hours,Real estate blockchain (make ICOs for real estates & decentralized airbnb),We need to have digital assets tokenized before having real estates tokenized.

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/crowdcoin,crowdcoin,2018-05-18,Demi,"- They are pretty active for a coin their size
- They have forked a coin and don't seem to have done any innovation
- They've been updating their github rigorously the past few days.
- They have published a new whitepaper (a few days ago) which looked really legit at the first glance but as I read more into it, it is a business paper not a technical paper which doesn't include game theories & other formulas solving problems.
- Sent them email, the email adress doesn't exists.",-1,Less than 1 hour,Building an ecosystem to learn/invest/news/exchange/fund cryptos.,"They are basically giving ICO/investment advice & helping people do ICO's. Thus they are actually a consultancy firm which has created their own coin, where I didn't understand why they needed the coin in the first place. Since they are updating & publishing more stuff their price can increase in the short term, but I see no long term value for this coin."
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aeternity,aeternity,2018-05-19,Doruk,"-Yanislav (CEO) is one of the earliest ethereum developers and core eth team member (he calls himself even “godfather of ethereum” https://medium.com/@yanislav/king-of-bitcoin-godfather-of-ethereum-a9af9ecf56d5
-PoW+PoS hybrid consensus algorithm will use Cuckoo Cycle as PoW which is energy efficient and runs on RAM. They claim even smartphones can mine ae in the future. Delegated voting will be used for PoS governance.
-This blockchain will use “oracles” as tamper proof data bridges which contracts can act upon. Contracts can pull real world data like the price of real world assets(ie gold), election results, weather conditions etc.
-State channels are offchain solutions, not a real essential breaktrough though but it’s important for businesses.
-Erlang has been used in aeternity’s architecture.
-AE is still ERC20 now which will be swapped to its native infrastracture coins, its ICO had two phases (april and june 2017). First phase price was $0.042 and second was $0.28 per token. (I contributed in both phases)
-Long wait for token distribution, lots of corporate tragedy (two CTOs have been fired, first one Zack is also one of the creators of aeternity’s whitepaper, and he is one of the earliest characters in cryptosphere but he acted very unprofessional on the process IMHO- childish hack threats on medium posts etc, he’s now making his own project called AMOVEO)
-It has a high level, OCaml based scripting language called Sophia which can be formally verified. It has also a simpler language called Varna. Both will support contracts and oracles.
-It will have its own dapps called aepps, not sure how much developer support can it take. Their team is quite competent indeed. (They have few PhD erlang devs)
-Euro-centered project, no asian hype, at least for now.
-Despite all of its corporate tragedy ae price has done well since ICO, I believe Yani’s strong ethereum connections are responsible in that.
-They must be in an independent security audit these days, after that mainnet release and token swap will be expected.",1,More than 5 hours,smart contracts interfacing with real world data,"The only real competitor of AE will be its oldest CTO’s solo project Amoveo which lacks a market existence, for now."
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zilliqa,zilliqa,2018-05-19,Doruk,"-Zilliqa leverages PoW for sybil attacks, establishing identities and performing sharding. However it achieves consensus through practical BFT in each shard.
-The most unique speciality of Zilliqa is linear scalability which means it processes more tps as more mining nodes join the network. It’s the opposite in almost every blockchain project.
-Very qualified team with a strong academic background. (one of my highschool friends took a class with their CSA Prateek Saxona at Berkeley in 2009 and he calls him pretty smart guy) Amrit Kumar is also a well known name in crypto-academic circles
-Zilliqa is developing a non Turing complete, I/O Automata based smart contract language called Scilla, they claim that not all apps require a Turing complete language and it becomes possible to prove interesting safety and liveness properties about a non-Turing complete program such as the funds never get locked, etc. Interesting approach IMHO
-The biggest critic comes from eth devs and they say that there is no state sharding in Zilliqa (Ethereum is planning to use state sharding in the future) However Zil’s team’s conclusion was that there still isn’t a state sharding scheme that is secure enough, but they are open for future implementations.
-They have Bluzelle and Genaro partnerships (Distributed storage) NEO also invested in Zilliqa
-Lately Indonesian bank BNI said that they will use a private blockchain system called Anquan which is powered by Zilliqa for remittances and trade finance.
-Lack of strong marketing, too much(asian level) nerdy team. Anyways their community is getting stronger everyday.",2,More than 5 hours,A secure sharding adaptation in blockchain,Zilliqa may be a real permissionless high throughput blockchain solution with its unique linear scalability. I expect an ADA like run from it when its mainnet release approaches (sometime in q3) %5-10 of all portfolio can be invested imho (mine is %11)
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/holo,holo,2018-05-20,Goku,"Holochain and blockchain are built for fundamentally different use cases. Blockchain is relatively good for systems where it’s absolutely necessary to maintain global consensus. Holochain is much better than blockchain at anything that requires less than universal consensus:
1. It’s faster: Since Holochain apps don’t have to sync everyone on the network for every change that happens, they can run much faster than apps on blockchains.
2. It’s more efficient: With no global syncing or mining, Holochain is exponentially more efficient and affordable than blockchain. This means it can be used for things like accounting for microtransactions that blockchains cannot address.
3. It’s scalable: Holochain can support applications with billions of simultaneous users thanks to its parallel architecture.
4. It’s adaptable: Users can adapt apps and protocols to meet their needs.
5. It’s extendable: Users can extend applications by linking them to other applications.  Anything a user can read out of one app, they can write into another.

- Holochain is the main project. Holo is the holofuel token on top. Hypetoken now, will bestable asset based coin in future.
- Made Holoport indiegogo campaign and raised $1M. Raised about $25M in ICO. 6x up from ICO.
- Distributes tokens with proof-of-service for serving your computing resources.
- Runs on linux for all computers.
- Every person has their own chain, signed by the user, each action is recorded.
- The 2 founders have been experimenting, writing, coding alternative currencies since 2007. They founded an open source project called metacurrency.
- First they are going to license their people to use their platform. Later they plan on opening to everyone.
- Their main engineers are very good.
- Sizhao Yang & Richard Burton following Holochain. Ryan Singer follow CEO. Mozilla CFO and Co-Founder of Netflix said good things.
- Funny quote from benchmarks: It's probably best to stick to ""HODLing"" your ETH, because it's a waste to try to do any computing with it. Running code and storing data on this ""global computer"" currently costs 100,000,000x to 1,000,000,000x the cost of doing the same computing on Amazon Web Services
- Circulating/Total Supply: 75% circulating, 25% is owned by the team.
- With few developers they do have, they care about what they are doing and are working hard.

- Red flag: There are too many people for marketing and evangelizing this project. Not many engineers. But their lead engineer seems like someone who can code everything by himself. Maybe this is a good thing?
- Red flag: Anonymity is very hard to achieve with Holo, which makes illegal activity less desirable.
- Red flag: No scientist for a complex system.
- Question: Holochain is supposed to be 10000x cheaper than blockchain, design makes sense but will it actually work?
- Tech: Haven't read the whitepaper and validated tech.",3,Less than 5 hours,Distributed Computing Resources,"- Seems like a guaranteed top 50 coin. Probably will be top 20. Has a shot at top 3.

- Zack is in hero mode and developing everything by himself. He's been developing for more than 1.5 years and did more work than most other blockchain projects.
11K ERL. 8K JS.
- Project is very new, very unknown expect hard core long term blockchain enthusiasts.
- Looks like the market cap was over $6 million. (Maybe?)
- VEO/BTC exchange is being built.

The 2 previous blockchain projects I founded:
* raised tens of millions in ICO.
* hired dozens of people.
* have not launched main net yet.
* mediocre growth

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nexo,nexo,2018-06-17,Demi,"- They get your btc, eth and they give loans in $ values.
- It is similar to using leverage in trading. But you're able to use the extra leverage on other investments in the mean time.
- They have interest rates on each month of your loan.
- Nexo is used to decrease interests by using it as collateral or as loan payments.
- Nexo token holders are paid dividends from 30% of the revenue.
- Thus the nexo token is more like BNB token.
- They are centralized, you need to trust them.
- Ranked 130 with mcap $100M

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/harmony,harmony,2018-05-25,Demi,"- Uses OmniLedger
- Team has ex-google/apple & phds
- Founder sold company spotsetter to apple
- Uses block-Dag instead of blockchain ??
- They have emphisized too much on the team but it looks like the team had no prior blockchain experience. They saw an oppourtunity and decided they could make a lot of money from it.
- I believe this team is smart & that they can raise some amount of money but I don't believe they will be able to create the next all working blockchain.
- They have just gotten together(May 2018), have done near no prior coding, they have researched many techs but I believe their advisors told them to to just use tech X, tech Y.
- In Sep 2017 they've written a shitty new language which I couldn't see a nitch/specific use case. It is ugly and they haven't updated it since October 2017.
- As I understood the founder has been developing the coding language for 10 years. But the lang has no community, no users, so it is shit, just a marketing ploy.
- Their white paper looks pretty good.
    - It is not like a technical white paper but they mostly mention how they are going to use which tech to include in to their system.
    - They're not doing innovation in core tech but they've spent time selecting the best ones to use (which they probably just got the names from advisors and didn't even research all the possibilities themselves)
    - Their innovation is in location based oracles (sounds like marketing ploy)
    - Another innovation is in their own programming language (I didn't understand if the language will be actually useful or shit) It had things like better syntax for sql, html, javascript which I believe makes it shit)
- Their token economic model shows me that they plan on dumping their coins slowly and in a few years all become filthy fucking rich and exit the market.
- They get a percentage of the coins every month, only %28 is locked up for 4 years. They might do their exit scam before the 4 years is up. They already have salaries from the ICO money, they have no justification to release %1.5 of their coins every month)

My thoughts and concerns:
- They are aiming to be a 3rd generation blockchain but most people know them as just a search engine. This should change.
- 3rd generation blockchain market is very competitive, they are relatively unknown compared to their competitors.
- PoD algorithm should be investigated, how they are going to determine “influential” users and will it be really different from PoS’s “rich gets richer” phenomena.
- They are trying to get developer’s attention by incentive program, I think this is a very good strategy.
- Their marketing has been terrible so far. The reason might be they heavily focused on product development and mainnet release.
- I think project can climb up to top 20 or even top 10 if they keep delivering and start proper marketing.",3,More than 5 hours,Decentralized search engine and 3rd generation blockchain.,"- The project is legit, I believe that this project has the potential of being a top 10 coin in CMC."

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/metronome,metronome,2018-06-18,Goku,"Idea:
* 8M/10M tokens available for sale.
* Company blogging since November 2017.
* Metronome attempts to create a stable, predictable money supply ad infinitum, using daily descending price auctions to distribute the token supply at market prices.  Through the Auction contract, an initial 8,000,000 MTN are sold in a 7-day initial descending price auction, followed by 2,880 MTN per day minted and sold in the daily auctions (through year ~30, where mintage hits a 2%-per-year inflation floor).
* Descending price Auction. The price descends by 0.0001984320568 ETH every 60 seconds. Users will have the option of buying Metronome at any price target they want until it reaches a minimum of 0.0000033 ETH. The starting price is 2 ETH. 2 ETH price = $8B raised. 0.0000033 ETH = $13K.
* All Ethereums collected in Metronome smart contracts can be sold back to Metronome buyers.
* Can move METs across different blockchains. Like ETH, ETC. Extra validators are needed to ensure which chain is the correct one while swapping between chains.
* Compares itself to and is competitor to BTC, LTC, ETH, XRP, ZEC as a currency.
* Has the ability to subscribe to a decentralized network by making weekly standard payments.

* Self-Governance: MTN tokens will be managed by its user community, with the system managed by autonomous smart contracts. There will be no third party with any special privileges either within the system or in the MTN marketplace.
* Reliability: Metronome was architected to provide rapid market price discovery, prioritize predictability and provide a steadiness to the MTN token supply over time.
* Portability: Metronome’s cross-blockchain capability uses a proof-of-exit receipt when users leave one blockchain, which enables them to enter another. The MTN token will be issued first on the Ethereum network, with Ethereum Classic, Rootstock on Bitcoin and Qtum support expected to follow. This will allow users to select the blockchain that suits their requirements for governance and security, or even upgrade the MTN contract if needed.

Team:
* Matthew Roszak, founder worked in Keystone Capital in 1995(Acquired by Coinbase), Was board member of a company that IPOd. Founded and worked 15 years in a company that raised $200M. Then founded a private investment firm that invests and acquires businesses for large moneys like $50M. Board member of a lot of late stage startups and companies, has strong networks in Chicago, NY, Toronto. Seems like producer or investor in The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin documentary. One of first investors in Blockchain Capital. Founded Chicago Blockchain Center. Chiairman of digital commerce. Founded Tally Capital that only invests in crypto stuff. Estimated to be a billionare. Started getting into ICOs since 2013. Gave Richard Branson and Bill Clinton their first BTCs. Andreas, Charles, Erik, Charlie, Nick all follow him in twitter.
* Founders invested in Dragonchain, Civic, Poet, Rivetz, Genaro recently.
* Jeff Garzik CEO is legendary in bitcointalk forum. Was Bitcoin core developer in Bitpay since May 2013 for 2 years.
* Founder shares, 75% of 2M MET are locked for 3 years.
* Gustav (Orchid cofounder, ETH core dev), Don Tapscott (Blockchain Revolution Author), Vinny (Civic) are advisors.
* Their Chief Cryptographer is founder of Coinlab, Bitcoin foundation. And advisor to DFJ, lightspeed, pantera etc..
* Some people say these founders have a lot of red flags, like having controversial issues about technology, lawsuits etc..
* A lot of the team is from Chicago and Toronto. Developers in github seem to be from Argentina.

Opinion:
* Not sure if incentives will make sure this is stable, it might just go moon.
* Its very possible that a lot of dumb people will go FOMO in without understanding the economics. And will pay 2 ETH for what will end up to be worth a 0.02 ETH coin. Losing 100x of their money. Clever way of scamming idiots. evolution at work.
* I'm guessing the first 2M will be sold very slowly. The next 4M will be sold faster, and the last 2M might deplete in 1 hour. Economically if we buy in the first 3M we will definitely lose money, in the first 5M we will probably lose money, in the last 3M, we will probably make money.
* I value this somewhere around $100M-$30M. So somewhere between 0.025 ETH - 0.0074 ETH entry price is good. Any higher than 0.025 might not worth it. If its near 0.0074, going all 10% of portfolio in might be worth it. If it goes below 0.002466667 for some reason, going more than 10% of portfolio might make sense. It will come to buyable price range in about 5 days.
* Presale starts Monday, should be ready to invest by Tuesday probably.
* It seems like because of economic incentives the price will be tied very closely to the blockchain market, so kind of like a stable coin, stabilizing based on the coin markets.
* This might be one of those coins to exit in 1 week or 6 months.
* They won't be launching and maintaining a blockchain. They will launch a few smart contracts, tie blockchains together, and let the decentralized web take care of the rest.
* Big innovation in fundraising and setting a fair price for all investors. There is no KYC, presale, whitelist or bonus.
* Since all ether is locked in a proceeds contract, the valuation for this will be equal to the valuation of all ethers in contract/all metronomes. This is the only cryptocurrency where the net valuation is very very clear.
* There could be serious fucking arbitrage opportunities in here. Via the daily auctions. First the opportunity will be big, then the market will get competitive and opportunity will get smaller.

We are pleased to open up the Private Sale for 10 days until 30 June. During this time the Perlin Token (PERL) will have a 20% discount and will be US 20c per PERL (reduced from 25c).

Some comment I found (https://icodrops.com/sparkster/)
Some things Sparkster don't want you to know
1. This was already a failing web company just months ago. They changed the name, deleted all records of that company and pretended they were blockchain. They had 0 investors befor Baline came along
2. Their CEO claims to be from CISCO. He worked there on a call centre two decades ago. He has zero experience in blockchain and has had nothing but small failed businesses in those 20 years
3. They have a workforce in India that they pay peanuts to hang around their own telegram group telling people that this will 50x. Check their twitter and you will see about 100 fake comments under every tweet.
4. They do not have any partnerships, have zero proper VC companies backing them. Only Ian Balina who is a paid shill. Not one staff member is from a blockchain background. Their ""development"" team are an outsourced tech sweatshop in Mumbai where they are paying around $500 per month wages.

- Their app lit is still in its infancy, lots of polishing needed
- Their price is increasing because they are able to get their coin on many exchanges also only a few % of the coin is changing hands thus price manipulation is easy.
- The concept has a few errors:
1. Mithril is mined through social media popularity. This encourages like for like, view for view behavior. How is mithril overcoming this problem?
2. As far as I've seen Lit is a centralized app. How can other social media developers integrate mithril to their platform? The blockchain needs to be able to process millions of micro transactions in order to validate each like/view, such scalaility does not exist yet on blockchains. From this I see that mith won't be useful until either they build their own scalable blockchain or ethereum ads sharding, where both solutions seem to have 2+ years. So will mith be any use in the next 2 years? If so what?
3. Mithril will be used by merchants thus giving it value, why would merchants use mithril instead of btc/eth/ltc?
- Telegram answer:
1. Our team have foreseen that  like/view for like/view might happens, so we have our solution to this.
2. We are building our own Mithril Ecosystem, and Lit is just the first product for it, so currently we are focusing on our to-do projects.
3. Use BTC/ETH/LTC as a payment method is also good. And we believe MITH will become  a great option for everyone to pay for their daily life, too :)

Doruk says they have changed another CTO after Zack. So their tech will probably never work.",-1,Less than 5 hours,Global Oracle Machine,"I think the team is doing an okay job at marketing. They've pumped the coin to top 30 and have a unique selling point so the coin could go much higher before people realize its tech doesn't work (if tech doesn't work)
Overall I don't want this blockchain/team to become succesful."
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/holo,holo,2018-05-10,Demi,"- Not a blockchain but a DHT like bittorent
- They have strong connections (CFO of Mozilla & Co-founder of Netflix)
- Project is in alpha but can still be built on using JS & Lisp
- Holo fuel will be live in Q3 2018
- It looks awesome on paper, anyone who looks at it for an hour will not see that token won't work. (we should invest at least 10%)
- We can hodl until holo fuel becomes live
- Founder(Arthur Brock) has been a CTO since 1996 and has been working on currencies since 2004
- They are hiring devs
- They've written protocol with Go
- They are agent centric(like git) rather than data centric(like bitcoin). So when an agent create a git repo only he has the power to change it. But doesn't prevent anyone from forking it.
- I didn't understand the technical part of the white paper, it may take me 5-10hours to think and understand it.
- They have TODOs in their whitepaper
- They have green paper & currency paper
- They use mutual credit, which means the token supply is always zero. When someone creates tokesn someone else goes to negatives.
- They use double entry ledger system, I'm not sure if it'll work.
- They have put some normal weaknesses in their Currency paper saying that they don't have good solutions for some attack types.
- Coins which have this much depth & tech with good marketing has a 99% chance of entering top 30 (which means increasing 4x from where it is right now)

- They built a blockchain company in 2015 which builds tools, gives seminars etc to their clients: https://encrypt-s.com/company/
- They work on Nav-coin but also other stuff as well. So their coin doesn't seem to support their funding.

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aion,aion,2018-05-04,Kan,"- Aion solves interoperability problem using bridges. Their system is broadly well thought however the more you dive the harder and complicated it gets.
- The way they look at the problem is better than Ark and Cardano. They plan to have bridge networks which can proxy other bridges rather than connecting all blockchains with each other.
- They have good marketting material however its hard to understand how they are solving the problem. So technical content almost do not exist except for whitepaper.
- Their solution doesnt work yet.
- It looks like CEO is focussed on finding people who can solve the problem.

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mysterium,mysterium,2018-05-08,Kan,"- Is prone to MITM attacks. Can implement 3 hop like Tor but will be expensive
- Discovery service will be shit on Blockchain. It'll cost too much gas. Hard problem to solve.
- Public Ledger will hold every single payment you did. It's equal to ISP/Government seeing all your logs but instead of Government everyone can see it. Need ring-sginatures to fix this.
- It does not provide any protections against Governments. Tor like features *might* be implemented but will take forever to build.
- The team hasn't answered any of these problems that I'm aware of.

Onchain->NEO
Onchain->Ontology

Founder of Ontology is also the founder of Onchain & its chief Architect

Ontology value will grow if NEO grows. Finishing the roadmap might take 5-10 years.

High activity on github. Most of their developers still work on Onchain? They are contributing to Onchains DNA repo.

NEO developerlariyla farklilar gibi, 1-2 kisi haric. Birde farki NEO developerlari calismiyor, ONT developerlari cok iyi calisiyor.

VCleri teyit ettim, cidden yatirim yapmislar. Partnerler hatta 20-50 sirkete yatirmis ama sadece 5 sirkette fulltime investor gibi yazmislar linkedine. Onlardan biri Ontology, en inandiklari projelerden biri bu gibi duruyor.

Twitterda takip ettigim hic kimse Ontologyden haberdar degil, genel olarak cin projelerinden haberdar degiller, NEOdan haberdarlar. ADA ve NAS hakkinda yeni haberdar oluyorlar. ONT, SKY vs haberdar degiller hala. Yani upside i yuksek duruyor. Bear markette girdi, henuz kimse bilmiyor, inceleyen insanlar incelemeyi birakti. Boyle cok yuksekte baslayan projeler genelde daha yuksegede cikiyor. Top 15 likely duruyor. Top 50dende cikmaz gibi.

Teknolojisi, tam anlamadim, emin olamadim ama potansiyelli duruyor.
