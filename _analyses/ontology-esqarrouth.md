Onchain->NEO
Onchain->Ontology

Founder of Ontology is also the founder of Onchain & its chief Architect

Ontology value will grow if NEO grows. Finishing the roadmap might take 5-10 years.

High activity on github. Most of their developers still work on Onchain? They are contributing to Onchains DNA repo.
They seem to be different from NEO developers except for 1-2 people. The difference is NEO devs don't work but ONT devs work.

I confirmed the VCs they really invested. Partners have written on linkedin that they invested in 20-50 companies but are only full time investors on 5 companies. Ontology is one of them. It looks like this is one of the projects they believe the most.

None of the people I follow follow on twitter know about Ontology. They seem kind of clueless about Chinese projects (except for NEO). They have recently learned about ADA & NAS. They still don't know about ONT, SKY. It looks like the upside is high. It also entered the market in bear market, not a lot of people know. Many people who were researching coins stopped researching them. Projects that start at a high rank usually go highler. Top 15 is likely to happen it doesn't look like ONT will leave top 50.

I couldn't exactly understand the tech but it looks like it has potential.

It is not clear who is in the team, most people are not at any western networks. But there is certainly some academic & blockchain experienced people.
