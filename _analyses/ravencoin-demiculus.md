conclusion: "- They have a strong shill as CEO which can easily propell this coin in to top 100 which is 4x increase\n- Since I haven't seen their whitepaper concepts developed I have the urge to wait and see if they can make it.\n- Their whitepaper concepts sound really easy. Even I can code those in to the blockchain.\n- Need to compare this to other asset blockchains before deciding."

General

- Bruce is like virtual CEO of raven coin
- Rank 240 $36M market cap (jun 6 2018)
- Will support unique assets where Game_Server_N:321343 can be a unique item in a game. Or Art:Monalisa could be a real life item.
- They have rewards where people who received Game_DawnOfCrafting tokens could be rewarded with RVN if the business is going well
- Creator of the token could message all token holders. Which is an interesting concept.
- But they haven't added these yet

Pros

- They are trying to be like bitcoin/amoveo where no team member is listed because it is a truly open source project.
- On twitter CZ, Mark Andreesen, Sizhao, Nick Szabo, Joseph lubin + 10 other good guys follows Bruce. (CZ only follows 16 people one of them is Bruce) https://twitter.com/cz_binance/following which means could get in to binance sooner or later.
- A really active community for a rank 240 coin
- They've explained their concepts really well. Anyone can easily understand how their blockchain will be used.

Cons

- Fork of bitcoin
- They try to prevent asics
- Their github seems to be all readme updates, they claim they are working on private but it looks fishy: https://www.reddit.com/r/Ravencoin/comments/8oxsh2/where_is_the_real_code/
- Watched bruces video, he is selling dreams, doesn’t say anything about how & why raven coin can succeed. There is nothing concrete. He is just promoting an open source project.
- It might pump a lot but I don’t see any way this coin will stay alive and be useful in 5 years.
- I don’t have enough knowledge in the asset coin market thus I’m not sure, but this coin doesn’t feel right.
