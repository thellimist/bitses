conclusion: "Nice vision, correct market. Has a chance to distrupt live video streaming market"
---

- It was possible to do live video transcoders in a distributed manner for a long time. They added incentives which came with cryptocurrencies.
- Livepeer relies on Truebit technology which is still under development.
- Livepeer has a unique mechanism to distribute tokens. It is an ERC-20 token. However, unlike other ERC-20 tokens Livepeer did not do an ICO rather they created something called MerkleMining. In short MerkleMining is a way to initially distribute tokens using a smartcontact. (1) You do a proof (2) submit it to a smartcontract (3) contract gives you LPT. Rather than using electricity, LPT's economic cost is the gas consumed by the contract. It's a unique concept.

- They have invented a new way to distribute tokens using the security of Ethereum blockchain.

```
10,000,000 initial LPT. This initial token will be generated and released to the crowd, team, early supporters, and community in a gradual rollout over the next 36 months.
* Founders and early team: 12.35% — vesting over 36 months from network launch.
* Pre-sale purchasers: 19% — vesting over 18 months from network launch. Purchasers have facilitated 3 years of runway for Livepeer’s lean, engineering focused core team.
* Crowd: 63.437% — generated over 3–18 months using the MerkleMine algorithm.
* Grant: 0.213% — immediate issued to a couple early advisors and contributors who helped Livepeer get off the ground.
* Long term project endowment: 5% — to be used to ensure the longevity of the Livepeer project.
```

- The token is used for staking. One can stake their tokens for a transcoder node and that transcoder will share the revenue they earn with their stakers. It's dPoS where the number of transcoders are in limited number. Another way to use tokens will be paying transcoders with LPT. 
- The problem they are trying to solve (the transcoder part) is really hard. 
- The team is capable of delivering the technology they are promising. 
- They might actually make live video streaming cheaper and even faster than their centralized counterparts. 
- The users of LPT are businesses/apps who want to do livestreaming such as Periscope or Twitch. In other words there is not need for an end user to know about what Livepeer is.
