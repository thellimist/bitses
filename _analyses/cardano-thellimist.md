Cardano has a lot of different parts it touches such as interoperability, governence etc. I went deep down the hole researching. The analyses would be a dozen pages at least if I tried to write down all of it. One point to note would be, Cardona is really ahead in finding a solution for Blockchain Interoperability. However, their solution requires hard fork to PoW chains and doesn't work with PoS chains yet. Finding a solutin to this problem is still really far ahead.
