conclusion: "- The dev just created a currency and left, there is no way of market penetration that I see.\n- Since the idea sounds okay and there isn't a lot of technical documentation, I couldn't understand if the idea their Dag system was shit or not so I gave it 0."

General

- Hidden dev (like satoshi)
- Isn't in any exchange. Except for a few shitty chinese exchanges.
- There are main blocks and transaction blocks, I didn't quite get the main block.

Pros

- No pre-mine, no ICO
- Everything seems to be maintained by the community.

Cons

- Looks like the original dev left? https://www.reddit.com/r/xdag/comments/8n5f1l/where_is_cheatoshin/
- The miners mine the coin and look for people to sell it just like in Veo, no actual forseable usecase?
- It doesn't look like they have a niche
- The whitepaper etc are all shallow. They don't explain much.
