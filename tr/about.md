## Bitsesin Varoluş Amacı

We were already doing research for our investments. But the more we have seen our
friends get scammed by ICOs, the more we felt the need to share our knowledge.
We are open sourcing all of our data. We are hoping we can
contribute to the field by being the most honest research group and exposing scams
as much as possible.

## What You Can Do

- Help out your friends by sharing Bitses.

## Other Projects

We're building [an exchange for Amoveo](https://amoveo.exchange/), one of the
most undervalued coins that we know which is currently being traded by OTC. You
may register at [amoveo.exchange](https://amoveo.exchange/) to learn when it is
launched.

We're also working on [a wallet holder](http://mywallets.co/). You can get your
username at [mywallets.co](http://mywallets.co/) before anyone else gets it.
