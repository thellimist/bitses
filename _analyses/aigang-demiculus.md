conclusion: "They look like they have just did ICO, took money and did nothing else."

- Built on top of ethereum
- White paper looks ameteur, they didn't invent most concepts but no referrals are given
- Github sucks, no real development can be seen
- It has been more than 6 months and their docs still have todos everywhere: https://aigang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/platform/predictions.html
- They don't look like they have anyone in the team capable of building a protocol

Edit (Jul 3 2018): A friend of mine has brought to my attention that they have been doing updates: https://medium.com/@augstar

He has also mentioned that it is still a shit coin so I won't look into it further unless more people want me to.
