- Strong business, technology probably is bad. Haven't seen anything unique or better.
- 50-100 employees https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/glosfer
- CEO doesn't know English (enough to do an interview)
- They try to make a blockchain for businesses (like Hyperledger Fabric). 
- No idea what Hycon Token does.
- If they can get Samsung as a customer even with an inferior technology that might be huge.
