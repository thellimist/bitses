General

- Founder is one of the exfounders of Antshares(NEO) and former director of Ant Financial’s Blockchain operation.
- They started a incentive program with 5M$ price pool. They are aiming to get developers’ attention.
- PoD algorithm should be investigated, how they are going to determine “influential” users and will it be really different from PoS’s “rich gets richer” phenomena.
- Three core elements of Nebulas, Nebulas Force(NF), Nebulas Rank(NR) and Nebulas Incentive(NI) will be online in 2018.

Pros

- Their github is one of the most active githubs in crypto space.
- Partnerships with GIFTO and Dolphin Browser.
- Whitepaper is very comprehensive.
- They are trying to get developer’s attention by incentive program, I think this is a very good strategy.
- Decentralized search engine concept is not so competitive and they are way ahead of their competitors.
- Number of DApps on Nebulas surpasses Ethereum's.

Cons

- They are aiming to be a 3rd generation blockchain but most people know them as just a search engine. This should change.
- 3rd generation blockchain market is very competitive, they are relatively unknown compared to their competitors.
- Almost zero marketing.
- Most dapps are games, the quality of the dapps is not that good.
