conclusion: "We need to have digital assets tokenized before having real estates tokenized. They are too early. Also I'm not sure if the team can handle the challenge. "

- ERC20 token                                                                                                                                                                                     
- They plan on doing ICOs for shopping malls and other real estates. So people can buy & trade a fraction of the mall.                                                                            
- Their white paper looks very legit (work has been put in to it)                                                                                                                                 
- The coin price is 20% of the ico price where ICO happened in 1 Nov                                                                                                                              
- Up until the ICO they tweeted daily after the ICO they tweet once a month                                                                                                                       
- They push new code about once a week.                                                                                                                                                           
- They are far behind their road map but have not update their road map.                                                                                                                          
- They seem to be more focused on regulatory things than the actual tech.                                                                                                                         
- In telegram the admin said when they finalize the regulatory problems they will update the site and then do the product release which I think will probably increase the token price by a lot. 
- They go to blockchain events take pics with famous people (like vinny)                                                                                                                          
- The method of tokenizing a proprety goes like this: They buy a property, put it in to a special purpose company, then tokenize that company. I'm not sure why ATL is needed here.               
- It might be better if they just tokenize properties without having their own coin. Thus they become a service company.
